# SeamesterðŸ“–

## Installation
In order to install SeamesterðŸ“–, you must first install Python and the 'pip' package manager. Right after, you can open the command-prompt and type the following command, corresponding to your operating system:

* Windows: ```pip install seamester```
* Unix/Linux: ```pip3 install seamester```

## Getting Started
The core of the SeamesterðŸ“– library, is the Course class. The course class contains the base definition of a course, and provides us with a stable ground to create a new Semester or a Degree. Semester is a collection of courses that belong to a summer/not summer semester. With the Semester class we can see what courses SeamesterðŸ“– has to recommend, based on rules that we apply, such as the average difficulty of the semester, the faculty of the courses, the average price of the courses and more:
```python
>>> from seamester import COURSES
>>> mycourses = [41542, 41531] # the courses we know we'll take this semester.
>>> semester = Semester([course for course in COURSES if course.number in mycourses], summer=False)
>>> semester.recommend(2, avg_difficulty=6.5, degree_treshold=['computer-science']) # a recommendation of 2 more 
                                              # courses based on an average difficulty of 6.5 or less.

```

## Add Groups & Courses
SeamesterðŸ“– provides you with the most simple way to add courses to the library. All you need in order to do so, is to create a new Group/Course object in their corresponding  file, and add them to the lists:
1. Navigate to ```objects.py```.
2. Create a ```Course``` object in the right location: 
```python 
>>> linear_algebra_2 = Course(...)
```
4. Add the Course object to its prerequisites list: 
```python
>>> linear_algebra_2.prerequisites = [linear_algebra_2, java_programming_2]
```
8. Add the Course object to the ```COURSES``` list: 
```python
>>> COURSES = [linear_algebra_2, ...]
```

1. Navigate to ```objects.py```.
3. Create a ```Group``` object in the right location:
```python
>>> linear_algebra_2_discord = Group(...)
```
5. Add the Group object to the groups list of the course: 
```python
>>> linear_algebra_2.groups = [linear_algebra_2_discord, linear_algebra_2_whatsapp]
```
7. Add the Group object to the ```GROUPS``` list: 
```python
>>> GROUPS = [linear_algebra_2_discord, ...]
```
